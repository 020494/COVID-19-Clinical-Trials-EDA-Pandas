# 📊 COVID-19 Clinical Trials EDA using Pandas

# Author: Lakshmi Yuvaraj

# 🧪 Project Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a massive global research effort, resulting in thousands of clinical trials. This project explores publicly available datasets from ClinicalTrials.gov to analyze the scope, focus, and evolution of these trials using Python, Pandas, and data visualization tools.

# 🎯 Objectives

Explore characteristics of COVID-19 clinical trials

Analyze trial phases, statuses, study designs, participant demographics

Discover trends in conditions, interventions, locations, and sponsors

Understand how research focus evolved over time

# 💡 Insights

COVID-19 was the dominant condition in clinical research.

Most trials targeted adults and elderly populations.

Phases 2 and 3 were most common—focusing on treatment efficacy and safety.

Respiratory conditions like pneumonia and ARDS were frequent study targets.

U.S., China, and European countries led in trial counts.

A decrease in trial initiation was seen post-vaccine rollout.

Diverse and inconsistent outcome measures challenge unified interpretation.
